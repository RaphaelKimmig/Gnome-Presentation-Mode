Have you been annoyed by gnome 3 turning off your display while you were
trying to watch eg Youtube videos?  No worries, you shall be helped :-)

Gnome-Presentation-Mode is a tiny gnome-shell extension that adds a new
entry to the power indicator (the menu that opens when you click the
battery icon).  While presentation mode is on the screensaver and the
automatic suspend will not kick in, allowing you to sit back and enjoy
whatever you are doing without having to wiggle the mouse every few
minutes.


Installation instructions: Just clone the repo, copy the extension to 
your gnome-shell extensions directory and restart gnome-shell (default:
alt+f2, type r, press enter).

git clone https://github.com/RaphaelKimmig/Gnome-Presentation-Mode.git

cd Gnome-Presentation-Mode

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

cp -r presentationmode@ampad.de ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

sudo cp org.gnome.shell.extensions.presentationmode.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
