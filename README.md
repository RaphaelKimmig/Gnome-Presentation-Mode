## About

Gnome Shell Extension Inhibit Applet is a gnome shell extension that gives you the ability to inhibit auto-suspend or screensaver from activating, simular to the original applet in gnome 2. It will add a new menu on the panel with a dynamically changing icon to allow the user to see if the inhibit applet is on without having to open the menu.

This was forked from Raphael Kimmig's Gnome-Presentation-Mode, in hopes to improve it and add more translations. I don't take an credit for the work that he has done on this extension so far.

## Installation instructions:
Go onto https://extensions.gnome.org and find the extension. It's much easier to install it through that website than manually.
If you wish to install it manually, just copy the "inhibit-applet@alexjnewt.hotmail.com" folder into:
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
